# SF3 Blender Addon
This is a repository that contains an addon for Blender to support importing and exporting [Simple File Format Family (SF3)](https://shirakumo.org/docs/sf3) models.

## Installation
You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/Shirakumo/sf3-blender-addon/releases/latest/) of the plugin. The zip file can be imported into Blender just like any other addon.

Activating the ``SHIRAKUMO_sf3_io`` addon should give you new menu entries under ``File > Import`` and ``File > Export`` for importing/exporting SF3 model files.
